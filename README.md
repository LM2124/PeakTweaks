# PeakTweaks

A handful of tweaks and fixes to make your Quality of Life a little better.

## Current features

- ### Hunger reduction around the campfire

  Ever had to wait several minutes for that **one** player to catch up, making your hunger bar fill halfway up even though *they're* the ones who are late?

  Now you can configure your campfire to **reduce, negate, or even regenerate hunger** while you're around it, even while unlit.
  
  **Note**: Disabled by default in Config file; works client-side, but everyone is encouraged to agree on the same settings, of course :)

- ### Tweak maximum voice volume

  Is 200% volume not enough for your friend's super quiet microphone?
  
  You can change the maximum voice volume to whatever you want now.

  Careful with the numbers, things can get loud quickly. But loud = funny!

- ### Boost microphone volume

  You can change your own microphone's volume.

  Note: There is perceived loudness compensation; so a value of 200% should truly sound 2x louder

- ### Fix joining with a Banana Peel in the map

  If you tried to join an ongoing expedition with a banana peel anywhere in the map,
  your game would get hard-locked.

  Joining mid-expedition is still ill-advised due to many other bugs, but at least you won't need to Alt-F4 now.

## Possibly Future Features

- A kick button; or something else to deal with AFK players.
- A bunch of other ideas I had have already been covered by other mods ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
